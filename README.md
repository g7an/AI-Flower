## Introduction

AI Flower is a flower shaped robot with expression recognition function. It is my Honour's project that I worked on for two semesters during my undergraduate study. It is enlightened by an [existing experimental product](https://github.com/androidthings/experiment-expression-flower) created by Google using Android Things.

In this project, I refered to the design of the existing project, and trained my own neural network for expression recognition using PyTorch. In order to have more computing power, I used Nvdia Jetson Nano instead of Raspberry Pi.
